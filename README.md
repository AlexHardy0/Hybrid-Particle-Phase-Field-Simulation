2D Simulation of Fluid-Particle Interactions

This repository contains the code developed as part of my PhD work at The Open University in the Mathematics and Statistics Department. The project involves simulating a 2D fluid-particle system using a combination of numerical methods.

The primary objective of this project is to simulate the behavior of a fluid-particle system. The simulation incorporates a phase field for the fluid, which is modeled using the finite difference method. Particle dynamics are also simulated using the finite difference method, specifically through the Langevin equation. The velocity field is solved using a Fourier spectral method. All these equations are coupled together to provide a comprehensive simulation of the fluid-particle interactions.
Methods Used:

Finite Difference Method:
  Applied to model the phase field of the fluid.
  Used to solve the Langevin equation for particle dynamics.

Fourier Spectral Method:
  Employed to solve the velocity field of the fluid.

Coupling of Equations:
    All equations are interconnected to ensure accurate simulation of the fluid-particle system.

Installation

To run the simulation, you will need the following dependencies:

  Python 3.10
  NumPy
